        <section class="mb-5">
            <p class="lead">Hi there! I’m an ESL teacher by profession and a passionate learner at heart. When I’m not guiding students through language and IELTS prep, you’ll find me immersed in app development, crafting innovative Python projects. From building time-planning tools to designing apps that enhance metaphysical abilities, I love exploring how technology can make life more efficient—and enjoyable.</p>

            <p class="lead">But there’s more to me than just tech and teaching. I’m deeply invested in skincare, health, and wellness, with a particular passion for supporting farm-to-table living. Whether it’s developing apps to improve access to fresh, healthy produce or simply trying out new recipes, I’m all about maintaining balance and well-being in everyday life.</p>

            <p class="lead">Beyond that, I’m fascinated by the science behind compatibility, delving into astrology, MBTI, and how various factors shape our relationships. My curiosity extends further into the realms of philosophy, physics, spirituality, and healing. I’m constantly exploring how these practices can nurture personal growth while fostering deep family connections.</p>

            <p class="lead">In recent years, I’ve become increasingly intrigued by the intricate link between our gut microbiome, biofeedback, and neurogenesis—how cleansing energy, mindfulness, and exercise contribute to both physical and spiritual health. By listening to spiritual teachers and studying quantum physics, quantum computing, and quantum consciousness, I’ve come to appreciate the profound connection between science, technology, and spirituality. Everything is interconnected—our bodies, minds, and the universe itself—creating a holistic view of existence. It’s this intersection of knowledge that fuels my passion for growth and transformation, where scientific innovation and spiritual insight come together to reveal new possibilities for living well and making a positive impact, starting with healing from within.</p>
