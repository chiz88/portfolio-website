    <h2 class="mb-3">Vision</h2>
    <p class="lead">I want to live a life that reflects a greater purpose—one where love, growth, and harmony guide me.</p>
    <p class="lead">I believe we’re all part of God’s story, working to create a world where love, justice, and grace can flourish, while staying true to the path He’s set for us.</p>
    <p class="lead">For me, science, spirituality, and faith aren’t separate—they come together to show how everything in life is deeply connected and meant to help us grow and transform.</p>
    <p class="lead">I hope to live a balanced life, where I take responsibility for my choices, work with others, and build stronger connections with God, my community, and the world around me.</p>
    <p class="lead">Even when life feels uncertain, I hold on to hope—trusting in God’s promise of redemption and striving to bring harmony between the physical and spiritual parts of life.</p>

    <h2 class="mb-3">Values</h2>
    <ul class="lead">
        <li><strong>God at the Center:</strong> I see God in everything and try to focus on growing spiritually and reflecting on His presence in my life.</li>
        <li><strong>Choose Love:</strong> I believe love is the most powerful force, helping us grow individually and together, while pushing past fear and division.</li>
        <li><strong>Freedom with Responsibility:</strong> God gives us free will, and I try to use it wisely, making choices that matter for me, others, and His bigger plan.</li>
        <li><strong>Grace in Growth:</strong> I accept that challenges and mistakes are part of life—they’re opportunities to learn, grow, and trust in God’s plan for me.</li>
        <li><strong>Life as Sacred:</strong> Life is a place to grow and learn, but it’s also a chance to live out God’s love and purpose in everyday moments.</li>
        <li><strong>Faith Meets Curiosity:</strong> I want to bridge what I learn from the Bible with what I discover through science and spirituality, finding wisdom in both.</li>
        <li><strong>Seek Purpose:</strong> Through prayer, mindfulness, and reflection, I try to better understand God’s will and my role in His story.</li>
        <li><strong>Hopeful Living:</strong> I trust in God’s promises, even when the future feels uncertain, and I try to make choices that reflect faith and love.</li>
        <li><strong>Together in Grace:</strong> Building relationships and communities that reflect God’s love is important to me—I value unity, compassion, and teamwork.</li>
        <li><strong>Respecting Others:</strong> Everyone’s experience and perspective is unique, and I try to honor that while staying rooted in God’s truth.</li>
        <li><strong>Embrace the Unknown:</strong> I’m open to the mystery of God’s creation, knowing there’s more to life than what we see or understand, and trusting in His purpose for it all.</li>
